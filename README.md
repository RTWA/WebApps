## About WebApps

WebApps is a Plugin driven Block ('widget') creator. It can be used as a flexible addition to any CMS, VLE or SharePoint site that allows for HTML input.

Plugins have configurable options which can be viewed through a simple `<iframe />` code. This provides great flexibility with an unlimited number of possibilities.

Apps are complex Plugins. They allow the developer to produce a deeper level of customisation options, whilst still producing similar `<iframe />` code to embed into your site. Some Apps may also produce an endpoint, in either JSON or XML, which can be used for displaying information in a variety of ways, including on Digital Signage.

In order to get started with WebApps, make sure you have downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/RTWA/WebApps/releases/latest) from GitHub.

WebApps is open source software which means all of our source code is availble for you to view, scrutinise, correct and submit! We are open to Pull Requests for our software or our documentation.
